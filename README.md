## Projects

1. **Market Research Analysis: Superannuation Fund Performance**
   - **Description**: a comprehensive market research project to analyze the performance of various superannuation funds using python and statistical methods.
   - **Notebook**: [Super_analysis/Super_analysis.ipynb](Super_analysis/Super_analysis.ipynb)
   - **Highlights**: 
     - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find top performers.  
     - highlighting competitive advantages and areas for improvement, aimed at enhancing fund strategies.
   - **Key Skills**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, data visualization, model evaluation.

2. **Temperature Increase Prediction Model**
   - **Description**:  developed a model to predict whether tomorrow will be warmer than today for 10 locations in Australia. Leveraged historical weather data and applied various statistical and machine learning techniques in R to forecast daily temperature changes.
  
   - **Notebook**: [Weather_forecast/Weather_forecast.pdf](Weather_forecast/Weather_forecast.pdf)  
   - **Highlights**:
      -Data cleaning and feature engineering (handling missing values, outlier detection, categorical encoding).
      -Utilized classification methods (e.g., Naive Bayes, random forest) to determine temperature increase likelihood.
      -Performed exploratory data analysis and data visualization to identify trends and patterns in the weather data.
   - **Key Skills**:  R, tidyverse, caret, ggplot2.

3. **Sentiment Analysis of Posts in a Webforum**
   - **Description**: Conducted Sentiment Analysis on web forum posts using R to assess user opinions and emotions.  
   - **Notebook**: [Web_forum_analysis/Report.pdf](Web_forum_analysis/Report.pdf)  
   - **Highlights**:
     - Analyse activity and language on the forum over time
     - Analyse the language used by threads
     - Analyse social networks online:
   - **Key Skills**: R, NLP, scikit-learn, data preprocessing.

4. **Population Density and Urban Growth Visualization**
   - **Description:**: A data visualization project examining how population density influences city developmentâ€”whether cities should expand horizontally or vertically. Employed both the Vega-Lite library and Tableau to create interactive maps and diagrams that highlight relationships between population density, house prices, energy usage, and public transport infrastructure across different cities worldwide.
   - **Notebook**: [https://datascience-arian-eskandari.github.io/Population_density/final-html.html] (https://datascience-arian-eskandari.github.io/Population_density/final-html.html)
   - **Highlights**:
    - Created geospatial maps to compare population densities around the world and their impact on urban planning.
    - Visualized correlations between population density, house prices, and private energy consumption using scatter plots.
    - Illustrated public transport networks in cities (e.g., Singapore and Melbourne) to demonstrate how density affects accessibility and travel efficiency.
    - Explored the societal and intangible toll of low-density living, including effects on community interaction and well-being.
    - Key Skills: Vega-Lite, Tableau, data visualization, geospatial analysis, storytelling with data.
