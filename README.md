## Projects

1. **Market Research Analysis: Superannuation Fund Performance**
   - **Description**: a comprehensive market research project to analyze the performance of various superannuation funds using python and statistical methods.
   - **Notebook**: [Super_analysis/Super_analysis.ipynb](Super_analysis/Super_analysis.ipynb)
   - **Highlights**: 
     - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find top performers.  
     - highlighting competitive advantages and areas for improvement, aimed at enhancing fund strategies.
   - **Key Skills**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, data visualization, model evaluation.

2. **Temperature Increase Prediction Model**
   - **Description**:  developed a model to predict whether tomorrow will be warmer than today for 10 locations in Australia. Leveraged historical weather data and applied various statistical and machine learning techniques in R to forecast daily temperature changes.
  
   - **Notebook**: [Weather_forecast/Weather_forecast.pdf](Weather_forecast/Weather_forecast.pdf)  
   - **Highlights**:
      -Data cleaning and feature engineering (handling missing values, outlier detection, categorical encoding).
      -Utilized classification methods (e.g., Naive Bayes, random forest) to determine temperature increase likelihood.
      -Performed exploratory data analysis and data visualization to identify trends and patterns in the weather data.
   - **Key Skills**:  R, tidyverse, caret, ggplot2.

3. **Sentiment Analysis of Posts in a Webforum**
   - **Description**: Conducted Sentiment Analysis on web forum posts using R to assess user opinions and emotions.
